# Introduction
GitHub helps developers to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. You could want to visualize data or build a new app, there‚Äôs a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can help you do it even better.

This article will guide you through the basic things you need to know about GitHub, like how to: 

- Clone a repository.
- Make a Pull Request, and
- Make a Commit.

## **Prerequisites**

- You need to have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
- You need to [Download and Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

GitHub helps every team member work together on a project from any location while facilitating collaboration. You can also review previous versions created at an earlier point in time.

GitHub is said to be the world‚Äôs largest coding community.

## Why GitHub?

GitHub provides the important DevOps features companies and organizations of all sizes need for their public and private projects.

It is also fairly easy to screw up your local Git repository, especially when you‚Äôre new at this, also, it is also very easy for your PC to get damaged or get stolen, or your hard disk can crash.

Hence, it is a good idea to push your work(code/technical doc) to a remote location for peace of mind and GitHub is one of the best remote hosting services to store your code. 

## Git vs GitHub

By now you might be wondering about the difference between **Git**¬†and¬†**GitHub** or maybe this will be your first time hearing about the differences between the two. Anyways, welcome to the show üòÅ

|S/N| Git                    | GitHub      
|--| -----------             |------------
| 1| **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**¬†is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that allows multiple developers or other contributors to work on a project. | **[GitHub](https://github.com/)**¬†is a cloud platform that uses Git as its core technology.|
| 2 | It makes it possible to work with one or more local branches and push them to a remote repository. | It simplifies the project collaboration process and provides a website, command-line tools, and overall flow that allows developers and users to work together.|
| 3 | Git is responsible for everything GitHub-related that happens locally on your computer. | GitHub acts as the "**remote repository**".|
| 4 | Key features provided by Git include: Tracks history, Free and open source, Creates backups, Scalable, Supports branching, used on your local machine without internet. | Key features provided by GitHub include: Issues, Discussions, Pull requests, Notifications, Labels, Actions, Forks, Projects.|

## How to Clone a repository

Cloning a repository(Project) will make a copy of the repository and its history on your local machine. To clone a repository, you can use the¬†`git clone [repo url]`¬†command or the GitHub CLI's¬†`gh repo clone [url]`¬†command.

They are several ways to clone a repository from GitHub, some of which are:

Through

- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- [Command line](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/intro_to_command_line/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- Etc.

But for the purpose of this article, I will be using **Command Line(CMD or Terminal)** to clone a repository.

To get started cloning a repository: 

Before you can use your Command Line, you need to know how to open it on Mac or Windows. Follow the on `How to open Command Line on Window` or `Mac` below to proceed. 

- [How to open Command Line on Window](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8mSZEVgGeE)
- [How to open Command Line on Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OFD_F5L_vk)


Now that you know how to open your Command Line, proceed to GitHub.

- Open GitHub and go to the GitHub repository that you want to clone.

![Clone-steps](https://res.cloudinary.com/utibe/image/upload/v1665096518/Technical%20writing/Screenshot_2022-10-06_at_4.16.52_PM_shwnlc.png)

- Click ‚Äú**Code**‚Äù**(arrow 1)** and on the pop-up screen, copy the repository URL by clicking on the two overlayed icons **(arrow 2)**.

![terminal](https://res.cloudinary.com/utibe/image/upload/v1665097347/Technical%20writing/Screenshot_2022-10-06_at_4.47.39_PM_cpgkpu.png)

- Open ‚Äú**Terminal or CMD**‚Äù on your PC and change the current working folder to the folder that you want the cloned project.
Use `cd..` to get to your default folder, `ls` to see the content of the folder, and `cd name_of_folder` you may want to move into. When you are in your desired folder, you can proceed to clone.
- Type¬†***git clone***¬†in the terminal, paste the **URL** you copied earlier, and press ‚Äú**enter or return**‚Äù on your PC keyboard to create your local clone.
- Wait for the process to complete.

Now you have a copy of the remote repository on your local machine, you can now open the project on your [IDE]("https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/ide/") if you want to.

## How to make a Commit

Before you can make a commit, it means that you already have existing source code or repositories stored locally on your computer or private network, and you want to save what you have done or working on already. You can do this by typing some Git commands directly on your Command line, or by using [GitHub CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli/github-cli/about-github-cli).

Using the **Command line** to make a commit, follow the steps below: 

1. In the command line, navigate to the root folder of your project.
2. Initialize the local folder as a Git repository with the command `git init -b main` if this is your first commit, if it is not your first commit, skip this step to the next step.
3. Stage and commit all the files in your project with the command `git add . && git commit -m "[your commit message]"`

## How to Create a Pull request

A pull request (or PR) is a way to alert repository (repo) owners or collaborators that you want to make some changes to their code. It allows them to review the code and make sure it looks good before putting your changes on the primary branch.
Before you create a PR, you may need to create a branch sometimes to make your changes. Click [here]("https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/create-branch) to see how to create a branch on Git.

![branch terminal](https://res.cloudinary.com/utibe/image/upload/v1665238005/Technical%20writing/Screenshot_2022-10-08_at_2.59.57_PM_leyrif.png)
Once you create a new branch off the primary branch, make changes, commit and push your changes, then, you can make a pull request.
The primary branch is the branch named `main` or `master`.

Here are the steps to make a pull request:

1. Open the GitHub repo of the project.
2. Click on **Compare & Pull Request**.

![Compare](https://res.cloudinary.com/utibe/image/upload/v1665239105/Technical%20writing/Screenshot_2022-10-08_at_3.08.25_PM_aux9ud.png)

1. Type a comment to best explain what your changes were all about in the **Leave a comment** section.

![Create pull request](https://res.cloudinary.com/utibe/image/upload/v1665239105/Technical%20writing/Screenshot_2022-10-08_at_3.11.31_PM_m1mfx6.png)

1. When you‚Äôre done with the comment, Click on **Create pull request**.

![Merge preview](https://res.cloudinary.com/utibe/image/upload/v1665239105/Technical%20writing/Screenshot_2022-10-08_at_3.20.06_PM_zwqw2w.png)

Congratulations ü•≥ü•≥üëèüëè¬†you have created a pull request, now it is left for your team to review your changes and approve, then, merge the pull request.

## GitHub Desktop vs Github CLI

| S/N | GitHub Desktop | GitHub CLI |
| --- | -------------- | -----------|
| 1.  | **[GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop)** is an application that enables you to interact with GitHub using a GUI instead of the command line or a web browser.   You can push to, pull from, and clone remote repositories with GitHub Desktop, and use collaborative tools such as attributing commits and creating pull requests. | **[GitHub CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli/github-cli/about-github-cli)** is a command-line tool that brings pull requests, issues, GitHub Actions, and other GitHub features to your terminal, so you can do all your work in one place.   |
| 2.  | GitHub Desktop encourages you and your team to collaborate using best practices with Git and GitHub. | It is an open-source tool for using GitHub from your computer's command line. |
| 3 | You can use GitHub Desktop to complete most Git commands from your desktop with visual confirmation of changes.| When you're working from the command line, you can use the GitHub CLI to save time and avoid switching contexts.|
|4 |  GitHub CLI and GitHub have some similar features such as: View, create, clone, and fork repositories, close, edit, view issues, pull requests, Review, diff, merge pull requests, Run, view, list, and delete releases, delete gists, and connect to a codespace.|

I believe you also understand the differences between GitHub and Git because when you‚Äôre new to GitHub, it‚Äôs easy to be confused between the two.  You also unserstand some features of GitHub like cloning a repo, making a commit, and making a pull request.

Finally, you also understand the differences between GitHub Desktop and GitHub CLI. This might be your first time hearing about the two or it is not your first time, but if it is your first time, you‚Äôll get to use them someday.

I believe that this article will help a lot of people trying to understand some things about GitHub and will help them to explore more of what GitHub can do.
